# Sakra Homebrew Taps

This a [Homebrew Tap][tap] repository containing a collection of my [Homebrew][homebrew] formulae.

## Usage

First, add this tap to your Homebrew installation. This will clone the repository and symlink all its formulae:

    brew tap sakra/tap

Now you can use these formulae in the same way as the regular Homebrew repository formulae:

    brew install sakra/tap/cblas
    brew install sakra/tap/clapack
